This project demonstrates how to use ReactJS, 
Redux, TypeScript, Webpack4, Ant Design, D3v5, ECharts and Mapbox. 
It is also including two kinds of D3 force simulation demonstrations along with 
gauge, which is based on my personal interest and previous project.

Furthermore, this project also demonstrates how to deploy the web app to Google
firebase, and use Google cloud function serverless platform with React frontend app.
